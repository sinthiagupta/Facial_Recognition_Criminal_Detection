Facial Recognition & Criminal Detection System
🔍 Project Overview
The Facial Recognition & Criminal Detection System is a real-time security application that can be used in public gatherings, events, airports, and institutions to identify individuals with criminal records. Users can upload a dataset of criminals, and the system will scan and match faces in real time. If a match is found, the system triggers an alert for authorities to take action.

This system is designed to be universal, meaning it can work with any dataset provided by the user.
