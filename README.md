# Facial_Recognition_Criminal_Detection
This project aims to enhance public safety by integrating real-time facial recognition with a criminal database. The system captures facial images from live camera feeds, processes them using deep learning (CNN), and matches them against stored criminal records. If a match is found, the system triggers an alert for security personnel.
