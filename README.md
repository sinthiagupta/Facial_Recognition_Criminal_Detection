# Facial Recognition & Criminal Detection System

 ## 🔍 Project Overview
The Facial Recognition & Criminal Detection System is a real-time security application that can be used in public gatherings, events, airports, and institutions to identify individuals with criminal records. Users can upload a dataset of criminals, and the system will scan and match faces in real time. If a match is found, the system triggers an alert for authorities to take action.

## This system is designed to be universal, meaning it can work with any dataset provided by the user.

## 🛠 Features
### ✔ User Authentication – 
Signup & Login system with face scanning
### ✔ Dataset Upload – 
Supports uploading criminal datasets dynamically
### ✔ Face Detection & Recognition – 
Scans live images and matches with stored records
### ✔ Embedding & Database Storage – 
Stores face embeddings in Pinecone for fast searching
### ✔ Real-Time Alerts – 
Sends notifications when a criminal is detected
### ✔ Web-Based Application – 
User-friendly interface for seamless access


## ⚙ How It Works
### 1️⃣ Admin Uploads Dataset →
Uploads images of criminals before an event
### 2️⃣ Preprocessing → 
Cleans images, extracts faces & stores in embeddings
### 3️⃣ Face Recognition → 
Users log in and scan their face
### 4️⃣ Matching & Alert →
System matches scanned face with stored embeddings
### 5️⃣ Access Granted / Denied → 
If a match is found, security is notified
